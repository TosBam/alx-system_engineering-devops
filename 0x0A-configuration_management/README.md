WHAT IS A PUPPET?

Puppet is a Configuration Management tool that is used for deploying, configuring and managing servers. It performs the following functions:

Defining distinct configurations for each and every host, and continuously checking and confirming whether the required configuration is in place and is not altered (if altered Puppet will revert back to the required configuration) on the host.
Dynamic scaling-up and scaling-down of machines.
Providing control over all your configured machines, so a centralized (master-server or repo-based) change gets propagated to all, automatically.
